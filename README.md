## Inento Application

Invento is a simple and internal Inventory Management System for Tyreworld Uganda (a fictional company). Tyreworld Uganda sales tires for all sorts of vehicles. It also offers some services related to the tires they sale. An example is tyre fitting. So when a customer for example buys tires, they may also request for the service of fitting the tyre. This service may be an after sale service or paid for separately.

Major goal of the system is to keep track of the movement of the stock. Management would like to be notified especially when item stock levels are low or critical. The company has two branches.However, stock is centrally managed at the Main branch.
